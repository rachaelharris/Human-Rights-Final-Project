## Introduction
Hello, everyone! This is the final project that I created for a class at Allegheny College during the Spring 2020 semester. This class was of the Political Science discipline, which is my second major. I was very lucky to work under the advision of Dr. Kirschner to create this project. Dr. Kirschner allowed me to combine my interests in Computer Science and Political science to create an interactive program! This program questions a user's knowledge of Human Rights, as that was the subject of the course.

## Research
To begin this project, I needed to do quite a bit of research. As someone who is familiar with the Java coding language, I wanted to push myself to do something that I had not done previously; to use a Graphical User Interface. I referenced a textbook for a previous Computer Science class, several websites, and several videos to get a solid understanding of GUIs. I felt that a GUI would be most aesthetic to the end user (not that the aesthetics are the most valuable part of a program, but for its intended use, I believed this to be helpful).
I also used websites related to Political Science to aid me in my knowledge of Human Rights, the Unviersal Declaration of Human Rights, and their enforcement. 

## Code
The code begins with several lines of import statements to be able to use and support a JFrame for the remainding code. The code then follows by creating the Class for the project. Within the class, every JFrame is created and instantiated. Each question brings a new JFrame, and they are all linked together via an ActionListener Button. Each question has two or more answer choices. The code will not allow the end user to continue until they select the correct answer. An error message will pop up if they do select the wrong answer. 

## Conclusion
While this may not be the most concise code and while it may contain a few bugs, it was something that I was proud to push and something that I was proud to work on. I was very happy to be able to find an overlap between two of my disciplines and to be able to use them to educate the end user.
