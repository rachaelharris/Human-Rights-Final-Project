## About

Human rights is a critical source of discussion in today's polarized political climate. There is an increasing issue in reporting, that the information is not only correct, but verified. This is critical, as the public recives most of their information in this way and depend on these outlets to be informed. According to [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zjykkmn), false information can take many forms (satire, clickbate, propaganda, and mistakes), and it can be classified as disinformation or misinformation. It is very difficult for the public to identify any media outlet or social media post as any of these classifications without reading competing claims or doing their own research. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to educate users on the basics of Human Rights. This project will show how a potential app or applet can be built and used by various platforms to provide correct, text-based information on Human Rights.

This tool will iterate through a series of 10 questions and attempt to educate users in a quiz-like style. Users can also choose one of three levels to participate on. Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced. Ideally, the user progresses from Beginning to Advanced. The goal of this feature is to maximize the amount of knowledge provided to the user. 

## Features

- JFrame to present questions, incorrect answer selections, and correct answer selections.

- Incorrect answer selection
  - Alerts user that the answer choice is incorrect
  - The user cannot proceed until the correct answer has been chosen
 
 - Correct answer
    - Alerts user that the answer choice is correct
    - Provides information and context as to why this is the correct choice

## Installation

- Clone the source code onto your machine

    With HTTPS:

    ```https://github.com/rachaelharris/Human-Rights-Final-Project.git```

    or With SSH:

    ```git@github.com:rachaelharris/Human-Rights-Final-Project.git```
    

## Run

After pulling the repo, use the command `java finalProject.java` to run the project. 


## Future work

Currently, this project requires cloning and running in a terminal window, though ideally, it could be an app or applet for users of particular websites (maybe relevant textbook sites, HRW, Forbes, or even the UN Council). In order to maximize usage of this project, there could be a development of a web-integration for the project. Another great addition to the project would be creating more detailed paths for the user to take and adding more (maybe more relevant) questions. The question frames could prevent a user from selecting the same ansewr choice twice and could present a score at the end (and an option to repeat).

## Reading Material

Here is the list of articles that may give the user more insights into human rights (as a general premise).

- [UDHR - Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights)

- [HRW - Human Rights Watch - World Report 2021](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2021)

- [UN OHCHR - What are Human Rights?](https://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/pages/whatarehumanrights.aspx)

- [The Advocates for Hunann Rights - Human Rights Basics](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/human_rights_basics/)

- [Forbes - Why We Should Care About Human Rights](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelposner/2018/12/09/why-we-should-care-about-human-rights-the-universal-declaration-of-human-rights-at-70/?sh=390b75794db0)


## Ethical Discussions

- What happens if the spread of information regarding human rights abuses is false or misinterpreted?


- Should we enforce educating citizens about human rights? Do media outlets and social media platforms have an obligation to promote this information?

- What are some of the ways we can prevent biases in the spread of information surrounding human rights as developers and as users?


## Data used

The files used in this project are retrieved from several online references to help create the J-Frame interfaces. The information provided on these interfaces was obtained from ["The Politics of Human Rights: The Quest for Dignity" by  Mark Gibney, Sabine Carey, and Steven C. Poe](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/politics-of-human-rights/A0F70BC1AB9DC28C1F264ECD393CD55C)
